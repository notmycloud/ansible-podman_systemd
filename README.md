# Ansible Podman_systemd
## Description
Configure Podman Systemd Units for system and rootless users.

IMPORTANT: Requires the installation of the `toml` python package. Install with pip.

## Usage
Provide the following variables for this role to operate correctly.
`PODMAN_SYSTEMD_INSTALL_COCKPIT` will install Cockpit with Podman support.
`PODMAN_SYSTEMD_ALLOW_LOWEST_PORT` will specify the lowest port that an unprivileged user can bind to. It is a debated thought that the low ports of 1024 or less are "secure" and should be limited to trusted users. If this is a multi-tenant server, it is recommended to skip this variable, however, if you manage this server entirely and setup users per service, this option can save you some headache. In my opinion, this can be set to 0 for a server that is not multi-tenant.
`PODMAN_SYSTEMD_ALLOW_PING` will allow unprivileged users to ping.
`PODMAN_SYSTEMD_DEPLOY` contains the bulk of the Podman configuration. Create a key for each user that will have a Systemd unit setup.
```
PODMAN_SYSTEMD_DEPLOY:
  root:
    etc...
  user1:
    etc...
  user2:
    etc...
```

## User configuration
Root will be configured under the default `/etc/systemd/system` directory wheras users will be configured under `~/.config/system/user` directory. In this example, we will configure for an unprivileged user.
```
PODMAN_SYSTEMD_DEPLOY:
  myuser:
    config:
      storage:
        storage:
          driver: "overlay"
        # key:value pairs that will be written as INI format for storage.conf. This will be placed in the appropriate directory for either a user or if the user is root, in the /etc configuration directory.
        # The key:value pairs should follow the format as specified by the notmycloud.yaml2ini role.

          env: 
            - "TMPDIR=$HOME/.cache/tmp/"
        # key:value pairs that will be written as TOML format for containers.conf. This will be placed in the appropriate directory for either a user or if the user is root, in the /etc configuration directory.
